Firmware to control a LED matrix board.
=======================================

This code is specifically targetted at the Paltronics PAL0103 board,
but should be fairly trivial to adapt to other hardware.

The board pinout is per the .ino file and the Arduino is connected
using the relevant pins. I will document further as time and demand
warrants.

This uses the libraries/Cli library to control it via Serial commands.
